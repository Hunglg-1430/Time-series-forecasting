# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction with LSTM

## ðŸ“Š Overview
Welcome to the Stock Market Analysis and Prediction project using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks! This project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into stock market data and predict future stock prices for four major companies: META, GOOG (Google), MSFT (Microsoft), and AAPL (Apple).

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Objectives
- **Data Gathering:** We collect historical stock market data for META, GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL using Yahoo Finance (yfinance).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We conduct in-depth EDA to understand the trends, patterns, and relationships within the stock data.
- **LSTM Modeling:** We utilize LSTM neural networks to build predictive models for future stock prices.
- **Visualization:** We employ various data visualization techniques to present our findings and predictions effectively.
